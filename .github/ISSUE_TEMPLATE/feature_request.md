<!--
All xmake-related projects are personal open source projects. The support of new features depends on the author (ruki)'s own schedule. Even if they are adopted, there is no guarantee that they will be supported immediately.
After submitting the request, you can wait patiently for a while. Of course, we also welcome you to submit a pull request directly to participate in code contribution.

Another option is to financially support the project through corporate sponsorship, which can also encourage us to have enough funds and time to quickly complete the development of new features. But the premise is that this feature has been adopted, so please contact the author to discuss further related feature requirements before sponsoring.
